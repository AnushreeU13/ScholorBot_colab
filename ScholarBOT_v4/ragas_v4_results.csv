Tuberculosis is diagnosed based on clinical evidence and epidemiological studies. The guidelines classify patients into high- and low-risk populations for tuberculosis. Diagnostic recommendations aim to lead to beneficial treatments and favorable clinical outcomes.

The diagnosis can involve assessing symptoms of TB disease or identifying latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Diagnostic methods may include tuberculin skin tests or interferon-γ release assays (IGRA). The recommendations are based on evidence synthesized by a task force supported by major health organizations.


### Patient Summary
Tuberculosis is diagnosed using clinical signs and studies. Patients are grouped into high-risk and low-risk for tuberculosis. Diagnosis helps find the right treatments for better health.

It looks at symptoms of TB disease or checks for latent TB infection. Tests may include skin tests or blood tests. Recommendations come from a group backed by major health organizations.

Some countries experience difficulties with the implementation and quality \nassurance of sputum culture, which impacts upon this recommendation as it is dependent on access \nto quality-assured laboratories that can offer TB culture.

The culture method is the gold standard \nfor detection of M. tb.in patient sputum. The major drawback of the cumbersome solid \nculture procedures is that M. tb. is a slow growing organism, requiring about 4–8\xa0weeks \nto obtain results; therefore, it is not used in routine TB diagnostics in clinical settings. \nFaster, more automated versions of the culture test in liquid media (Mycobacteria \nGrowth Indicator Tube (MGIT) and BacT/ALERT) reduce the time-to-results to \n10–14\xa0days; however, for some samples it may still take as long as 8\xa0weeks to obtain the \nfinal result, and it is also expensive.

Culture also facilitates phenotypic testing for DST, a critical consideration in TB diagnostics. \nHowever, performing culture requires considerable logistical organization and a well-equipped \nlaboratory to limit cross-contamination, ensure proper bacterial growth and match other quality \nstandards. Apart from the resource requirements, culture results become available after a significant \ndelay of weeks or months, contrasting markedly with the relative immediacy of the result of direct \nmicroscopy (although microscopy cannot confirm mycobacterial viability).

The difficulty is that the gold \nstandard itself is about 85% sensitive (Anonymous 2000). This means that a diagnos-\ntic test benchmarked only against culture and determined to have 100% sensitivity is \nlikely not to be more than 85% sensitive.

Sputum culture conversion refers to the change from a positive to a negative sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) during treatment. It is important in TB management as it indicates that the treatment is effective and the patient is responding positively. Successful sputum culture conversion is essential for confirming that the patient is no longer infectious.

Monitoring sputum culture helps in identifying any signs of treatment failure or recurrence of TB. Quality sputum specimens are necessary for accurate diagnosis and culture results, impacting treatment decisions.


### Patient Summary
Sputum culture conversion means changing from a positive to a negative test for tuberculosis (TB) during treatment. It shows that the treatment is working and the patient is improving. Successful conversion helps confirm that the patient is no longer spreading TB.

Checking sputum culture helps find any problems with treatment or if TB comes back. Good quality sputum samples are needed for accurate tests, which affect treatment choices.

What is the role of sputum smear microscopy in TB diagnosis?,"['Current Diagnostics\nThere are a number of test types for the detection of active TB.\xa0Diagnosis of active TB \nin high burden countries is primarily based on sputum smear AFB microscopy and \nchest X-ray (CXR).

Any sign of recurrence after termination of treatment \nshould also be investigated using sputum smear microscopy, culture and DST .\n5.4 Implementation considerations\nGood-quality sputum specimens are necessary to ensure that laboratories can diagnose TB properly. \nIn addition, laboratories should have sufficient space to ensure the quality, safety and efficiency of the \nservices provided to clients whose samples are tested, and to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, \npatients and visitors (97). Some countries experience difficulties with the implementation and quality \nassurance of sputum culture, which impacts upon this recommendation as it is dependent on access \nto quality-assured laboratories that can offer TB culture. Sputum smear and culture examinations are \nalso dependent on the quality of the sputum produced, so care should be taken to obtain adequate', 'test for bacteriological confirmation of TB than direct microscopy of sputum and other biological \nspecimens. Culture also facilitates phenotypic testing for DST, a critical consideration in TB diagnostics. \nHowever, performing culture requires considerable logistical organization and a well-equipped \nlaboratory to limit cross-contamination, ensure proper bacterial growth and match other quality \nstandards. Apart from the resource requirements, culture results become available after a significant \ndelay of weeks or months, contrasting markedly with the relative immediacy of the result of direct \nmicroscopy (although microscopy cannot confirm mycobacterial viability). While molecular techniques \ncan now provide a rapid and reliable diagnosis, they cannot replace culture or microscopy for the \nmonitoring of bacteriological status during treatment.\nThe evidence used to explore the added value of culture over sputum smear microscopy alone, and', 'TB diagnostics\nUntil recently, the acute diagnosis of TB relied solely on\nsmear microscopy and chest radiography. The single-\nmost important advance in TB diagnostics in recent years\nis the development of the automated Cepheid Xpert\nMTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) platform that\ncan identify M. tuberculosis in an unprocessed sputum\nspecimen in less than 2 h. With an overall sensitivity of\n88% compared with sputum culture, it offers an incre-\nmental increase in sensitivity over smear microscopy of\napproximately 30%.\n73 In a pragmatic clinical trial, Xpert\nMTB/RIF testing was used effectively by nurses in primary\ncare healthcare facilities resulting in increased rates of\nsame-day TB diagnosis and treatment initiation com-\npared with a smear microscopy approach.\n74 Trials of a\nnew battery operated platform (GeneXpert Omni;\nCepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, US A) using next-generation\nXpert MTB/RIF Ultra cartridges (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA,', 'USA) with reported sensitivity approaching that of TB cul-\nture are currently underway.\n75,76\nNew urine-based diagnostics may help to meet the\nchallenge posed by patients with suspected TB who are\nunable to produce a sputum specimen.

In addition, \nchildren often have difficulty producing proper sputum sample; PEDTB accounts \nfor 6–20% of TB.\xa0Therefore, in roughly a third of all TB cases, sputum is not a \npractical diagnostic specimen.\nRecent Advances in\xa0Tuberculosis Immunodiagnostics', 'does not exclude pulmonary TB.

Sputum smear microscopy is primarily used for diagnosing active TB in high burden countries. It is one of the main diagnostic methods alongside chest X-ray. The method has low sensitivity, meaning it may not detect all cases of TB.

Good-quality sputum specimens are essential for accurate diagnosis. Sputum smear microscopy can be used to investigate signs of recurrence after treatment. Results from microscopy are available more quickly than those from culture methods. While microscopy provides immediate results, it cannot confirm the viability of mycobacteria.


### Patient Summary
Sputum smear microscopy helps find active TB in places with many cases. It is a main test along with chest X-ray. This method may miss some TB cases.

Good-quality sputum samples are needed for accurate results. It can check for TB returning after treatment. Results come back faster than culture tests. It shows quick results but can't confirm if the bacteria are alive.

Isoniazid is used for the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. It is recommended to extend the maintenance phase of treatment with isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 3 months in certain situations. This extension results in a total maintenance phase of 9 months of treatment. The recommendation for isoniazid use is based on very low certainty in the evidence.


### Patient Summary
Isoniazid treats certain types of tuberculosis. Sometimes, treatment with isoniazid and rifampin should last 3 extra months. This makes the total treatment time 9 months. The advice about isoniazid is based on weak evidence.

Rifampin is an antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). It plays a crucial role in TB therapy by being part of the standard treatment regimen. Rifampin is effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB.

It is particularly important in managing multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB outbreaks. Rapid molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) for rifampin helps identify resistance, which is a good indicator of MDR-TB.


### Patient Summary
Rifampin is an antibiotic for treating tuberculosis (TB). It is a key part of the standard TB treatment. Rifampin works against the bacteria that causes TB.

It is important for treating tough cases of TB that resist other drugs. Quick tests for rifampin help find drug resistance, showing if TB is hard to treat.

Ethambutol use requires monitoring of visual acuity. Patients should be assessed for the ability to discriminate between red and green colors. In children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored, the risk-benefit ratio of ethambutol should be considered.

Ethambutol can be used to treat active tuberculosis in infants and children unless there is another contraindication. There is a risk of ethambutol-related visual impairment, which can be difficult to diagnose in children.


### Patient Summary
Check vision regularly when using ethambutol. Test ability to see red and green colors. Consider risks and benefits for children if vision can't be checked.

Ethambutol can treat active tuberculosis in infants and children unless there's a reason not to use it. There is a risk of vision problems from ethambutol that can be hard to notice in children.

Combination therapy is used to cure tuberculosis and rapidly reduce disease transmission. It helps to reduce the bacillary population quickly, interrupting transmission. The therapy prevents the selection of naturally resistant strains, avoiding the emergence of drug resistance. Combination therapy also aims to sterilize the lesion, preventing disease recurrence.


### Patient Summary
Combination therapy helps cure tuberculosis and stop its spread quickly. It lowers the number of germs fast, which helps stop transmission. This therapy prevents the growth of drug-resistant germs. It also aims to clean the infection area to stop the disease from coming back.

Severity assessment guides deci-\nsions around (a) place of treatment (whether in the community, in hospital, or in intensive care), (b) depth of investigations,\n(c) speed of treatment and (d) type of treatment, including the choice of antimicrobial agents and route of administration. Various\nseverity assessment tools have been developed for the management of patients presenting with CAP. The two most widely validated\nand adopted tools are the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB65 score. Both of these were developed to predict short-\nterm, 30-day mortality in patients presenting to hospital with CAP. Prognostic tools to predict ICU admission are not as widely used\npartly due to differences in ICU admission policies inﬂuencing the predictive accuracy of tools developed in one healthcare system\nand applied to a different healthcare system.', 'Patients transferred to an ICU after\nadmission to a hospital ward experience\nhigher mortality than those directly\nadmitted to the ICU from an emergency\ndepartment (64– 67).

What factors influence initial antibiotic selection for CAP?,"['General considerations\nInitial antimicrobial therapy for CAP is almost invaria-\nbly empirical. Determining the microbial aetiology of\ndisease not only allows targeted therapy with the\nresultant bene ﬁts of optimized clinical ef ﬁcacy and\nreduced promotion of antimicrobial resistance, but also\nprovides valuable local surveillance data on the tempo-\nral trends in CAP pathogens.\n61 CAP management\nguidelines in high-income countries recommend that\nboth empirical antimicrobial therapy and the extent of\ninvestigation to determine microbial aetiology are\nbased on severity assessment.\n61,62 Patients with severe\ndisease initially receive the broadest spectrum treat-\nment to cover all likely pathogens and in tandem\nundergo the most extensive investigation to maximize\nthe chance of later targeting therapy. In reality, how-\never, identifying the causal pathogen in CAP is chal-\nlenging: even with extensive investigation in the\ncontext of research studies, it is only achieved in', 'in combination with a macrolide resistance\nrate of.30% amongS. pneumoniaeisolates\nin the United States, most of which is high-\nlevel resistance (95). However, in settings\nwhere macrolide resistance is documented\nto be low and there are contraindications\nto alternative therapies, a macrolide as\nmonotherapy is a treatment option.\nPatients with comorbidities should\nreceive broader-spectrum treatment for two\nreasons. First, such patients are likely more\nvulnerable to poor outcomes if the initial\nempiric antibiotic regimen is inadequate.\nSecond, many such patients have risk factors\nfor antibiotic resistance by virtue of previous\ncontact with the healthcare system\nand/or prior antibiotic exposure (see\nRecommendation 10) and are therefore\nrecommended to receive broader-spectrum\ntherapy to ensure adequate coverage. In\naddition toH. inﬂuenzae and M. catarrhalis\n(both of which frequently produce\nb-lactamase), S. aureus and gram-negative\nbacilli are more common causes of CAP in', 'stability has been introduced into clinical\npractice, patients have shorter durations of\nantibiotic therapy without adverse impact\non outcome (210).

Initial antibiotic therapy for CAP is typically empirical, based on severity assessment. Patients with severe disease receive broad-spectrum treatment to cover all likely pathogens. The extent of investigation to determine microbial aetiology is influenced by the severity of the disease.

Patients with comorbidities require broader-spectrum treatment due to their vulnerability to poor outcomes. Comorbid patients often have risk factors for antibiotic resistance from previous healthcare contact or antibiotic exposure. Macrolide resistance rates among S. pneumoniae in the U.S. influence antibiotic selection, with low resistance allowing for macrolide monotherapy in certain cases.

Rifampin may require changes to antiretroviral therapy (ART) when added to treatment. Efavirenz is the preferred antiretroviral when incorporating rifampin into ART. Rifabutin is recommended as a substitute for rifampin when combining with protease inhibitors and ritonavir.

The standard dose of rifabutin in such cases is 150 mg/day. Drug absorption can be affected by food; levels of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide decrease when taken with food. Variations in drug absorption and excretion of rifampin can be influenced by transporter gene products.


### Patient Summary
Rifampin may change your antiretroviral therapy (ART) when added to treatment. Efavirenz is the best choice for ART with rifampin. Rifabutin is a good substitute for rifampin with protease inhibitors and ritonavir.

The usual dose of rifabutin is 150 mg per day. Food can affect how well drugs are absorbed; isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide levels drop when taken with food. How rifampin is absorbed and removed from the body can be affected by certain genes.

What precautions should be considered when prescribing fluoroquinolones?,"['be informed on the advantages and possible disadvantages, and make an informed decision on the \nregimen of choice. Previous exposure of less than 1\xa0month duration to the second-line medicines \nused in the regimen needs to be ascertained, and can be considered along with any additional DST \nresults available. Based on the available evidence, this regimen can be a preferred option for patients \nwith confirmed MDR/RR-TB (with at least confirmed resistance to rifampicin), for whom resistance to \nfluoroquinolones has been ruled out, in the following situations;\n• without resistance or suspected ineffectiveness of a medicine in the shorter regimen (except \nisoniazid resistance34);\n• without exposure to previous treatment with second-line medicines in the regimen for more than \n1\xa0month (unless susceptibility to these medicines is confirmed); \n• with no extensive TB disease and with no severe extrapulmonary TB; \n• not pregnant; and \n• if a child, aged\xa06\xa0years or more.', 'CL: 0.2–1.1). Acquisition of additional resistance with progression to MDR-TB was also reduced when \nfluoroquinolones were added to a ≥6(H)REZ regimen (aOR: 0.10; 95% CL: 0.01–1.2), albeit with small \nabsolute numbers: 0.5% (1/221) of patients on ≥6(H)REZ plus fluoroquinolones acquired resistance to \nrifampicin compared with 3.8% (44/1160) of patients who did not receive fluoroquinolones. Residual \nconfounding could have increased this observed effect. The directness of the evidence was therefore \ndowngraded because it was unclear whether fluoroquinolones were used at the beginning of treatment \nor only once drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were available (in the second month or later).', 'necessary as the use of the shorter regimen increases, as does the use of bedaquiline as part of \nthe longer regimens. Resistance mutations to fluoroquinolones detected using MTBDR sl should be \nconsidered a contraindication for the shorter regimen.', '3.5; 8.4), and for REZ it was 9\xa0months (IQR: 7; 11). Hence, in the observational studies that informed \nthe IPD, it seems that treatment length was based on the completion of 6\xa0months of treatment with \na fluoroquinolone.\nAcquisition of drug resistance. The analysis suggested that amplification of resistance to rifampicin \nwas lower in patients receiving the 6(H)REZ regimen (0.6%) than in those receiving >6(H)REZ (4.3%). \nThis observation could be due to the effect of selection and allocation of patients into specific \nregimens; for instance, the number of patients with extensive disease was slightly larger in those \nreceiving >6(H)REZ. However, overall, the number of observations for each comparison was small \nand the effect was not statistically significant (aOR: 0.2; 95% CL: 0.02–1.70).\nAdverse events. Data on adverse events were not evaluated owing to a of lack of standardization \n(dissimilar reporting). The GDG also considered two reports containing data from patients from', 'regimen, including implementation considerations for national TB programmes. \n Î A new 6–9-month regimen composed of bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid \n(BPaL) has been conditionally recommended for use in patients with MDR/RR-TB and \nadditional fluoroquinolone resistance, under operational research conditions only. \nA new section (Recommendations – Section 4) has been added to these guidelines \nto describe the evidence that was assessed in relation to this regimen, the eligible \npopulation and the conditions of use as part of operational research studies.\n Î Additional guidance on the safety of extended bedaquiline use (beyond 6\xa0months), \nthe concurrent use of bedaquiline and delamanid, and the use of bedaquiline during \npregnancy has been provided in the section on longer regimens for MDR/RR-TB \n(Recommendations – Section 3). The grouping of medicines into Groups A, B and C \nhas not changed since the previous guidelines were issued by WHO in 2018.', 'with polyresistant disease.\nSupport and close monitoring of patients are needed in order to maximize treatment adherence and \nenable early detection of patients who are not responding to treatment (e.g. those with persistent \nsputum culture or smear positivity).

First, the safety profile of this medicine is better characterized than that of other \nfluoroquinolones, and levofloxacin was the fluoroquinolone most frequently used in the studies', 'the United States of America (USA) in whom a detailed assessment of adverse events suggested \na risk of excess hepatotoxicity with the 6(H)REZ combination (18). Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is \nnot uncommon with anti-TB drugs. It has also been reported in individuals receiving rifampicin and \npyrazinamide for 2\xa0months for the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) – in such individuals, a \nmuch higher occurrence of hepatotoxicity has been observed than in those receiving only isoniazid \npreventive therapy (19). It is not known whether the risk of hepatotoxicity differs between 6REZ \nand 6HREZ.\nAddition of a fluoroquinolone. In patients with Hr-TB, treatment success rates were higher when \nfluoroquinolones were added to (H)REZ regimens than when patients were treated with 6(H)REZ or \n>6(H)REZ without the addition of fluoroquinolones (aOR: 2.8; 95% CL: 1.1–7.3). With the addition \nof fluoroquinolones in patients receiving (H)REZ, the number of deaths was reduced (aOR: 0.4; 95%', 'and, preferably, the ruling out of fluoroquinolone resistance using WHO-recommended tests.\nRapid molecular tests such as Xpert® MTB/RIF and LPAs are preferred, to guide patient selection for \nthe (H)REZ–levofloxacin regimen (25, 31).\nDrug-resistant TB surveillance indicates that fluoroquinolone resistance among patients with \nrifampicin-susceptible TB is generally low worldwide (32). However, national data on the prevalence \nof fluoroquinolone resistance – including targeted or whole-genome sequencing to detect specific \nmutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones (33) – could help to guide testing policies \nwhen countries implement the Hr-TB treatment recommendations.\nWhen additional resistance (e.g. to both fluoroquinolones and pyrazinamide) is suspected or \nconfirmed, treatment regimens that include other second-line TB medicines may have to be designed \nindividually. The current review could not provide further evidence on effective regimens in patients']","### Clinician Summary
Assess previous exposure to second-line medicines for less than 1 month before prescribing fluoroquinolones. Confirm that there is no resistance to fluoroquinolones before prescribing. Ensure the patient does not have extensive TB disease or severe extrapulmonary TB.

Avoid prescribing to pregnant patients. Prescribe only for children aged 6 years or older. Consider resistance mutations to fluoroquinolones as a contraindication for the shorter regimen. Be cautious about the timing of fluoroquinolone use in relation to drug susceptibility testing results.


### Patient Summary
Check if second-line medicines were used for less than 1 month before giving fluoroquinolones. Make sure there is no resistance to fluoroquinolones before giving them. Ensure the patient does not have serious TB or severe TB outside the lungs.

Do not prescribe to pregnant patients. Only prescribe for children 6 years or older. Think about resistance mutations as a reason not to use the shorter treatment. Be careful about when to use fluoroquinolones based on drug test results.

Adherence to tuberculosis treatment is crucial to prevent the rate of reinfection, which is higher than the rate of new tuberculosis cases. Successful treatment requires consistent medication intake to ensure the bacteria are fully eradicated. Non-adherence can lead to treatment failure and the potential for exogenous reinfection.

Improving adherence is essential for managing tuberculosis patients effectively and reducing the overall burden of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes the importance of adherence in tuberculosis management.


### Patient Summary
Taking tuberculosis medicine as prescribed is very important to avoid getting sick again. You need to take your medicine regularly to get rid of the bacteria completely. Not taking your medicine can cause treatment to fail and lead to new infections.

Sticking to your treatment plan helps manage tuberculosis better and lowers the number of cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights how important it is to follow your treatment.

Incomplete TB treatment can lead to treatment failures. There is a higher risk of death associated with incomplete treatment. Patients may experience relapse after incomplete treatment.

Incomplete treatment increases the likelihood of reinfection. Delays in mycobacterial clearance are common with incomplete treatment. Patients may remain sputum smear-positive, indicating treatment failure. Incomplete treatment can contribute to the acquisition or amplification of drug resistance.


### Patient Summary
Not finishing TB treatment can cause problems. There is a higher chance of death if treatment is not completed. Patients might get sick again after not finishing treatment.

Not completing treatment can lead to getting infected again. It often takes longer to clear the bacteria with incomplete treatment. Patients may still test positive for TB, showing treatment isn't working. Not finishing treatment can lead to drug resistance.

The purpose of standardized TB treatment regimens is to provide clear guidelines for national TB control programs and public health agencies. These regimens are based on updated recommendations that consider the benefits and potential harms of various treatment options. Standardized regimens help in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of drug-resistant TB management.

They aim to bridge the knowledge gap between efficacy, effectiveness, and current practice to enhance disease control. The recommendations are developed in compliance with WHO standards to ensure consistency and reliability in treatment approaches.


### Patient Summary
Standardized TB treatment plans give clear rules for health programs. These plans use the latest advice on treatment benefits and risks. They help manage drug-resistant TB better.

They aim to improve how TB is treated and controlled. The plans follow WHO standards for reliable treatment.
